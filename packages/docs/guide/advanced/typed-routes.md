Hi,

I was assigned as the dnsdir reviewer for ietf-dnsop-glue-is-not-optional.

The document is on standards track and describes the DNS Glue requirements in
Referral Responses. It updates RFC1034 (one of the core RFCs for DNS). The
draft is well written and easy to understand.  The document is ready for
publication.

Mini
yes

Major issues:
none

Minor issues:
none

Nits:
   RFC1034 uses "in domain" (section 3.5) but the proposed change uses
  "in-domain" 
  
Regards

Nic
